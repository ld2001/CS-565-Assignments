Note: 
Professor mentioned ~ 8 git commits were expected for the project. The project took well more than 8 commits; however, they were in the previous versions of the file (assignment 1, assignment 2) which had us working on the project. As I went along, there were different versions of the project that were created, and the final project version is a copy of the previous work. I made more git commits on the final day by pasting some previous project versions, but to see previous commits, see assignment 1 and assignment 2 folders.

•	Created roughly outline as per assignment 2. Included lots of joking items like my favorite car, as well as a variety of other. 
•	Also included anchor tags, images, other weights.
•	No CSS implemented, all CSS is inline into the project. 

10/24/2019-
•	Created more advanced HTML, including icons and links. Things are plotted in a way to facilitate CSS with IDs and Classes on every tag. Intend to use CSS grids or bootstrap to facilitate the webpage. 
•	Sections, divs, etc. are properly named

Things to do/challenges:
•	Bootstrap, change the font and color of font so it’s white and shows better on navbar. Tried changing the borders using CSS, but not working
•	Can’t get rid of white spaces on the side with background grid elements. 
Fixed: 
•	Worked with professor to move the bootstrap file above the CSS, to prevent CSS from getting overwritten. This was a major problem solved as that allowed CSS to actually be used instead of overwritten constantly.
